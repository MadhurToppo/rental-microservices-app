  <p><span>At some point in the Bioinformatics </span>Institute<span>, biology students no longer understood what did the computer science students said: they spoke a strange set of sounds.</span><br></p> 
  <p>And one of the biologists had suddenly discovered the secret of computer science students: they used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">substitution cipher</a> in their communication, i.e. they replaced each symbol of the initial message to the corresponding another symbol. Biologists gained the key to the cipher and now they need help:</p> 
  <p>Write a program that can encode and decode the substitution cipher. The program accepts two input strings of the same length; the first line contains the characters of the original alphabet, the second line - the symbols of a resulting alphabet, then goes a line you need to encode by the transmitted key, and another line to be decrypted.</p> 
  <p>For example, the program takes the following input:<br> </p>
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">abcd
*d%#
abacabadaba
#*%*d*%</code></pre> 
  <p>It means that symbol <b>a</b> of the initial message is changed to symbol <b>*</b> in the cipher, <b>b</b> changed to <b>d</b>, <b>c</b> — to<b>%</b> and <b>d</b> — to <b>#</b>. You need to encode the string <b>abacabadaba</b> and decode the string <b>#*%*d*%</b> using this cipher. So you get the following lines, which you should be the output of the program:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">*d*%*d*#*d*
dacabac</code></pre>
