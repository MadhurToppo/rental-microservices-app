  <p>When Anthony read "War and Peace", he wondered how many words and how much of them were used in this book.<br></p> 
  <p>Help Anthony to write a simplified version of a program that can count the words, separated by a space and output the resulting statistics.</p> 
  <p>The program must read one line from the standard input and for each unique word in this line output the count of its repeated occurrence (<b>case insensitive</b>) in the "word amount" format (see the output example).</p> 
  <p>The order of words output may be arbitrary. Each unique word must appear in the output only once.</p>
